/**
 * View is a sorting mechanism. View represent bucket of draw and compute calls.
 *
 * Compute and draw calls inside bucket are sorted in the way that all compute calls are executed before draw calls.
 * Compute calls are always in order of submission, while draw calls are sorted by internal state if view is not in
 * sequential mode. In the most of cases when z-buffer is used this change in order is not noticable to desired output.
 * In cases where order has to be preserved (for example in rendering GUIs), view can be set to be in sequential order.
 * Sequential order is less efficient, because it doesnâ€™t allow state change optimization, and should be
 * avoided when possible.
 *
 * By default views ids are sorted in ascending order. For dynamic renderers where order might not be known until
 * the last moment, view ids can be remaped to arbitrary order by calling setViewOrder. View state is preserved
 * between multiple frames.
